"""By-signature installer for the switcher's coordination hooks in
`~/.claude/settings.json`. Coexists with any other tool's hooks (including
token-slayer's own pre-existing attribution hook) by touching ONLY entries
whose command string carries our signature (`"token-slayer "`/`"slayer "`)
and round-tripping everything else verbatim — including non-hook keys like
`"model"`.

No tokens ever pass through settings.json; this module only shells out
command strings and JSON structure.
